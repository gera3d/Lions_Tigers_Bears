Okay, I have applied all the feedback to the style guide I gave you. Here is the updated version:

# Brand Style Guide

## Logo

The logo is a hexagon with a white background and a blue border. The logo has a gray square in the center with a blue and a teal shape on either side. The shapes on the sides are abstract and resemble a mountain and a wave. The word "EXPLORE" is written in all caps below the hexagon.

The logo represents the brand's values of adventure, discovery, and nature. The logo should be used consistently and appropriately across all media and platforms.

### Logo Usage

- The logo should always be displayed in its original colors and proportions. Do not alter, distort, or rotate the logo.
- The logo should have enough clear space around it to ensure its visibility and legibility. The minimum clear space is equal to half the height of the hexagon.
- The logo should not be placed on busy or cluttered backgrounds that compromise its readability. Use a solid color or a simple gradient as the background.
- The logo should not be combined with other logos, icons, or graphics that may confuse or compete with it.

### Logo Variations

- The primary logo is the full-color version with the word "EXPLORE" below the hexagon. This logo should be used whenever possible and appropriate.
- The secondary logo is the full-color version without the word "EXPLORE". This logo can be used when space is limited or when the brand name is already present elsewhere.
- The monochrome logo is the black-and-white version of the primary or secondary logo. This logo can be used when printing in grayscale or when color is not available or suitable.

## Color Palette

The color palette consists of four colors: blue, teal, gray, and white. These colors are inspired by the natural elements of water, sky, earth, and snow. The colors should be used in harmony and balance to create a fresh and vibrant look.

### Color Usage

- The blue color is the primary color of the brand. It should be used for the logo border, the mountain shape, and other prominent elements that need to stand out.
- The teal color is the secondary color of the brand. It should be used for the wave shape, accents, and highlights that need to add some contrast and interest.
- The gray color is the tertiary color of the brand. It should be used for the logo square, backgrounds, and text that need to be subtle and neutral.
- The white color is the background color of the brand. It should be used for the logo background, white space, and text that need to be clear and legible.

## Typography

The typography consists of two fonts: Montserrat and Open Sans. These fonts are modern, clean, and versatile. They complement each other well and create a professional and friendly tone.

### Typography Usage

- Montserrat is the font for the logo wordmark and headings. It should be used in all caps and bold weight for the logo wordmark, and in regular or bold weight for headings.
- Open Sans is the font for body text and captions. It should be used in regular or light weight for body text, and in regular or italic weight for captions.
- The fonts should be used in appropriate sizes and alignments to ensure readability and hierarchy. The fonts should not be stretched, skewed, or distorted.

## Imagery

The imagery consists of photos and illustrations that showcase the brand's theme of exploration and nature. The imagery should be high-quality, relevant, and engaging.

### Imagery Usage

- The photos should feature landscapes, scenery, wildlife, or people that relate to the brand's values and message. The photos should have natural colors and lighting that match the brand's color palette.
- The illustrations should be simple, flat, and geometric that echo the style of the logo. The illustrations should use the brand's color palette and have a consistent stroke width.
- The imagery should not be cropped, resized, or edited in a way that compromises its quality or meaning. The imagery should not contain any text or logos that may conflict with the brand's identity.
